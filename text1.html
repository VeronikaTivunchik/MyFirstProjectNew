Node.js has generally caused two reactions in people I've introduced it to.
Basically people either "got it" right away, or they ended up being very confused.

If you have been in the second group so far, here is my attempt to explain node:

- It is a command line tool. You download a tarball, compile and install the source.
- It let's you run JavaScript programs by typing 'node my_app.js' in your terminal.
- The JS is executed by the V8 javascript engine (the thing that makes Google Chrome so fast).
- Node provides a JavaScript API to access the network and file system
